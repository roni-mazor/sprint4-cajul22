## Technology Stack
The technology stack i used was MERN - MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js .
The app uses webSockets to update the board in real-time , without the need to refresh the page to get updates.
The API calls to the backend are done with the REST API method , and we used middlewares to authenticate and authorize actions.
